# if it is not found it will return the closest match
# the closest match is found by a variety of methods
# we will time each method and return the method that takes the least amount of time
# if it is a CIK it will search the cik_name.csv file
# if it is found it will return the cik else it will none
# if it is a ticker it will search the ticker.csv file
# if it is found it will return the CIK else it will return none
