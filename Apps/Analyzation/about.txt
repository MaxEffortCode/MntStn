Takes data from data base and tries its very best to 'clean' the data.

It may also discard data we've deemed useless

It will also 'compress' the data by doing some minor processing.
    Example:
        if we know we just need the combination of stock-price and volume, but volume is already stored from
        another function, it can just point to that other functions field in the database. Basically lets try not to 
        repeat data and try to keep the meta-data as small as possible.

It will store all this 'cleaned' and 'compressed' data in a part of the DB known as "meta-data"
    meta-data is the data that all high-intensity processing from the Decision directry will take place.

The applications in this repo should be called by Decision.

The applications should first check if the values it is asked to return already exist
    in an up-to-date database table, if not, it should update the table along with
    returning a value.

applications in this repo should be as 'basic' and quick as possible
